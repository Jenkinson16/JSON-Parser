# **App Name**: PromptParser

## Core Features:

- Ethical Prompt Parsing: Parse natural language prompts into structured JSON format, leveraging Hugging Face Transformers for bias detection and fairness metrics to ensure inclusive JSON schemas. The tool will fine-tune a BERT-based parser based on user feedback, which is logged.
- JSON Display & Validation: Display the parsed JSON in a user-friendly, editable format. Provide real-time validation feedback using Socket.IO.
- AI-Driven Prompt Enhancement: Suggest enhancements to the prompt using a LangChain-based multi-agent system. One agent parses the prompt, another validates the JSON schema, and a third suggests improvements to ensure compatibility and effectiveness.
- Session Storage: Store prompt and schema data temporarily during the session.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated purple (#A020F0) to convey innovation and intelligence.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) to ensure readability and a modern, clean aesthetic.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) for interactive elements and highlights to draw user attention.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif for a modern and neutral look.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying JSON and code snippets.
- Use clear, minimalist icons to represent different prompt categories and actions.
- Subtle animations to provide feedback during prompt parsing and JSON validation.
